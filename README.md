# Highly-Available-Web-Setup
In this simple project, I will be using Terraform (Infrastruture as Code), via VS Code, to set up a small network using AWS cloud services to host a single web server. The main objective of this project is to have a network be highly available and allow HTTP traffic from the internet access my network. To achieve this, I will create a VPC with two public subnets that will be accessible from different Availability Zones, addressing the high availability requirement. I will also set up an Internet Gateway to enable communication across the internet and to a security group that will allow HTTP traffic to enter the network.
