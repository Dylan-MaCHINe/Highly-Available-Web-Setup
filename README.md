# Highly-Available-Web-Setup
I will set up a small AWS network to host a single web server. The network will be HA and allow HTTP traffic from the internet. I will need to create a VPC with two public subnets in different AZs. I will also set up an Internet Gateway to enable communication with the internet and a security group to allow HTTP traffic.
